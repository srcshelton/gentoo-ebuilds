# Fixes for compiling prefix packages on macOS 10.13 (High Sierra) and later

For the High Sierra release, Apple have fixed a known vulnerability by causing
code which uses the '`%n`' `printf()` format in a string stored in writable
memory to crash with an `illegal instruction: 4` error.  Sadly, this is a
runtime error rather than a compiler error, making it difficult to detect.
Known failures currently exist in `vasnprintf()` implementations - these cases
are automatically detected and patched by deploying the Portage `bashrc`
override file from [local/etc/portage/bashrc](/local/etc/portage/bashrc)
to `${EPREFIX}/etc/portage/` and copying the accomdanying patch from
[local/etc/portage/patches/All/vasnprintf.patch](/local/etc/portage/patches/All/vasnprintf.patch)
to `${EPREFIX}/etc/portage/patches/All/`.

Two affected packages which use an older `vasnprintf()` implementation which is
incompatible with the supplied patch are as follows:

* dev-util/pkgconfig
* dev-vcs/cvs

... which are explicitly patched in an overlay package.

It is unlikely that this change affects only `vasnprintf()` code and no other,
so further patches will likely also be required...

# Fixes for compiling prefix packages under macOS using LLVM/clang

Some packages will fail with `illegal instruction: 4` if compiled with certain
compiler-optimisations enabled.  Indeed, the `-ftrapv` flag will cause `clang`
to intenionally insert `ud2` (Undefined Instruction) op-codes where integer
overflows could occur, and this catches-out a significant number of packages,
causing them to crash with `SIGILL` - illegal instruction.  To work around this
on a per-package basis where `-ftrapv` has not been used during compilation,
perform the following steps:

```
mkdir ${EPREFIX}/etc/portage/env

cat > ${EPREFIX}/etc/portage/env/debug <<EOF

# Assuming that clang is now default...

#CC="${EPREFIX}/usr/bin/clang"
#CXX="${EPREFIX}/usr/bin/clang++"

CFLAGS="-arch x86_64 -march=x86-64"
CFLAGS="${CFLAGS} -fcolor-diagnostics -O0 -g -pipe"
CFLAGS="${CFLAGS} -Wno-implicit-function-declaration"

CXXFLAGS="${CFLAGS}"
#CXXFLAGS="${CXXFLAGS} -stdlib=libstdc++"

#LDFLAGS="${LDFLAGS} -stdlib=libstdc++"

MAKEOPTS="-j1"

#PKGDIR="${PORTDIR}/packages/clang"

# vi: set syntax=conf:
EOF

cat >> ${EPREFIX}/etc/portage/package.env <<EOF
~sys-devel/binutils-apple-6.1 debug
EOF
```

... correcting for `CFLAGS` as appropriate in
`${EPREFIX}/etc/portage/env/debug`.

A similar configuration file could be added for all packages which fail to
compile with clang and require gcc.  An (unfortunately incomplete) list of
these packages consists of:

```
~dev-vcs/subversion-1.7.19
~sys-devel/binutils-config-3-r03.1
~sys-devel/gcc-apple-4.2.1_p5666
~sys-libs/db-5.2.42
```

(subversion presents an issue - it cannot be compiled with clang, but if
`USE="perl"` then the same compiler must be used to build subversion as was
used to build perl)

... with a slightly larger set of builds failing if `FEATURES="strict"` or
`FEATURES="stricter"`, or if `MAKEOPTS` is not set to "`-j1`".

# Fixes to allow `/var/state` to be used in place of `/var/lib`

`/var/state` was referenced in the [Filesystem Hierarchy Standard 2.0](http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/docs/fsstnd/fhs-2.0.tar.gz)
as superseding `/var/lib`, although versions 2.1 and later no longer mention
this particular configuration.  Regardless, supporting `/var/state` (with a
symlink from `/var/lib` for compatibility) takes very little effort, and the
name `state` feels like a much better fit with respect to the intended
contents.

# Fixes for MIPS n32 and x86\_64 x32 ABIs

Included is a modified `eclass/multilib.eclass` that no longer overrides any
amd64 `LIBDIR_*` environment variables, which may now usefully be set in
`/etc/portage/make.conf`.  For this to work universally, you may need to edit
`/etc/portage/repos.conf` and add:

```
[DEFAULT]
eclass-overrides = srcshelton
```

... to ensure that main-repo ebuilds benefit from the change.  The `LIBDIR`
variables, and their default values, are:

```
LIBDIR_amd64="lib64"
LIBDIR_x32="libx32"
LIBDIR_x86="lib"
SYMLINK_LIB="yes"
```

... noting that `SYMLINK_LIB` defaults to `"no"` (e.g. do not try to symlink
`/lib` and `/usr/lib` to the library directory which the ABI actually uses) for
x32 profiles, and that these variables only affect multilib systems.
